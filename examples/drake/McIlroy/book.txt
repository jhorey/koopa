If you are not a UNIX adept, you may need a little explanation, but not much, to understand this pipeline of processes. The plan is easy:

* Make one-word lines by transliterating the complement (-c) of the alphabet into newlines (note the quoted newline), and squeezing out (-s) multiple newlines.
* Transliterate upper case to lower case.
* Sort to bring identical words together.
* Replace each run of duplicate words with a single representative and include a count (-c).
* Sort in reverse (-r) numeric (-n) order.
* Pass through a stream editor; quit (q) after printing the number of lines designated by the scriptâ€™s first parameter (${1}).
